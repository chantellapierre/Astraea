This astronomy events application will allow amateur astronomers to find information about astronomical events for hobby astronomy and astrophotography. The target audience of this application is astronomy hobbyists of any age group. I will primarily be using IP Geolocation’s Astronomy API, which provides data on timing of “sunrise, sunset, moonrise, moonset, sun azimuth, moon azimuth, sun altitude, moon altitude, sun distance from the earth and moon distance from the earth from latitude and longitude or an IPv4 or IPv6 address for a given date.” 
This API is free and my application will allow users to create a free account with a full name and email address. Their personal information and password will need to be secured. This application will allow users to input their address and find astronomy events that will be visible to them, providing a photo of the event and how to find it in the night sky based on a common constellation signpost viewable from their hemisphere (e.g. Ursa Major). Users will be able to create calendar alerts for future events, “favorite” events, and post user photos to their accounts with hashtags that will allow their photos to be visible to other users viewing the event pages with the relevant hashtag.
